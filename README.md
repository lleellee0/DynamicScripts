<b>dynSimpleSetup.sh</b>
This script is used in conjunction with the dynStartupScript.sh script. It is a non, or rarely changing script that will pull the latest dynStartupScript.sh script and run it. This allows us to have a static location for a release script so we can use one line startup commands while always running the latest script. 

<b>dynStartupScript.sh:</b>
This script is a one stop shop. Run it on your VPS and it will do everything hands off. It will mine for you, it will scrape for you, it will auto update when new versions come out, it can even setup a dynode for you. Simple and easy. If you set it as a startup script, you will never need to log into your VPS.
